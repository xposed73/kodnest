### Write a java program to demonstrate the use of integer data types.

```java
class Program {

  public static void main (String args[]){
  
    //usage of byte
    byte age = 22;
    System.out.println("Age is: " + age);
    
    //usage of short
    short fresher_salary = 30000;
    System.out.println("Fresher slary is: " + fresher_salary);
    
    //usage of int
    int exp_salary = 70000;
    System.out.println("Expected salary is: " + exp_salary);
    
    //usage of long
    long population = 987654321789L;
    System.out.println("The total population is: " + population);
  
  }


}
```

### Write a java program to demonstrate the use of real number type data by storing the percentage od a student and value of Ï€, also display the data.
```java
class Program {

  public static void main (String args[]){
  
    //usage of float
    float percentage = 98.75F;
    System.out.println("The percentage os student is: " + percentage);
    
    //usage of double
    double pi = 3.1428571428571;
    System.out.println("The value of pi is: " + pi);
  
  }

}
```

### Write a java program to demonstrate the use of character (char). 
Note: in JAVA, the char is stored in single quotes 'X'

```java
class Program {

  public static void main (String args[]){
  
    char a = '3';
    char b = 'X'
    
    System.out.println(a);
    System.out.println(b);
    
    // char c = 'XP' (Throws error, since more than one character is not allowed)
  
  }

}
```
